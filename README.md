FEWD assignment 1

## Who am I?
My name is Lloyd McVey II. I've been involved with tech in one form or another for about 25 years. I'm married, have no kids but 6 furbabies(3 dogs and three cats).

## What do I do for fun?
* hang out with my wife and puppies
* Church functions-I do disabled ministry and youthgroup. ie I get to borrow other peoples kids and send them home :)
* program and build stuff. I love to tinker. My wife is always trying to make me get rid of spare parts etc.(I just mention her shoe collection and that line of thought seems to disappear.
* table top RPGs
* many other nerdy things.

I'm a fairly boring guy these days. I like things that way. I enjoy these classes because they've made me see things anew. Theres a lot I've learned on my own and worked on over the years but nothing beats the classroom experience and I've made some friends which doesn't come easily for me.

So, to complete this assignment I need an image; just a sec while I find something cool. ![dwarf](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Gimli_son_of_Gloin_by_Perrie_Nicholas_Smith.jpg)
